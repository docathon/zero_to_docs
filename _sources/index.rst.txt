Zero to Docs
------------

Back in the day, people built documentation by hand. That meant
hand-coding websites, tutorials, examples, and API explanations.
Now there are tools that let you easily render text files into a
professional website.

One such tool is Sphinx, a package that scans your codebase for
structured text, and uses this to convert it into beautifully-rendered
webpages. Sphinx also has an ecosystem of plugins that will let you
extend its functionality.
