Zero to Sphinx
--------------

Back in the day, people had to build documentation by hand. That meant
hand-coding websites, tutorials, examples, and API explanations. Luckily,
there are tools that let you easily render text files into a
professional website.

One such tool is Sphinx, a package that scans your codebase for
structured text, and uses this to convert it into beautifully-rendered
webpages. Sphinx also has an ecosystem of plugins that will let you
extend its functionality.

This is a quick introduction to sphinx,
and will cover setting up a simple sphinx section of your project. It won't
cover every piece of the sphinx world, but will try to hit 80% of usecases
for a small-to-medium-sized project.

First things first, this material is heavily based off some
readily-existing sphinx guides that are out there.
